## Introduction to Programming and Java ##

### **Software**
-  It is a solutionâ€”an automated solution for real-world problems.
-  It is a set of programs used to develop applications according to business requirements.
### **Program**
-  A set of instructions given to the machine for a specific task.
### **Programming Language** 
-  The language used to write a set of instructions.
-  **Examples:** C, C++, Java, Python, C#, Ruby.
-  To execute the program, we need a platform.
### **Platform**
-  It is a place that runs (executes) a program.
-  It is a combination of software (OS) and hardware (microprocessor).
-  Without a platform, we cannot run the program.

## History of Programming Languages
-  C
    - In the 1970s, C was introduced.
    -  These were platform dependent and procedure or function-oriented.
    -  For example, a large company with 250 employees is working on a project and wants to communicate, it is impossible to work only with C language.
- C++
    -  In the 1980s, C++ was introduced.
    -  It is a object oriented and platform dependent
    -  Suppose people living in different countries work on the same project. Still, communication is not possible with C/C++, so to overcome this, Java was introduced.
-  Java
    -  Java is object-oriented (building applications in objects) and platform independent (meaning the application built on one platform can be executed on a different platform).

## Java
-  High-level, object-oriented programming language
-  Platform independent
-  Platforms Java can run on: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android

### Platform independent
The code developed on one system can be executed on another system with a different operating system (as long as JVM is present). This is called platform independence.
