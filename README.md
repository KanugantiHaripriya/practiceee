# CoreJava Note -1 
## Introduction to Programming and Java 

### **Software**
-  It is a solutionâ€”an automated solution for real-world problems.
-  It is a set of programs used to develop applications according to business requirements.
### **Program**
-  A set of instructions given to the machine for a specific task.
### **Programming Language** 
-  The language used to write a set of instructions.
-  **Examples:** C, C++, Java, Python, C#, Ruby.
-  To execute the program, we need a platform.
### **Platform**
-  It is a place that runs (executes) a program.
-  It is a combination of software (OS) and hardware (microprocessor).
-  Without a platform, we cannot run the program.

### History of Programming Languages
-  C
    - In the 1970s, C was introduced.
    -  These were platform dependent and procedure or function-oriented.
    -  For example, a large company with 250 employees is working on a project and wants to communicate, it is impossible to work only with C language.
- C++
    -  In the 1980s, C++ was introduced.
    -  It is a object oriented and platform dependent
    -  Suppose people living in different countries work on the same project. Still, communication is not possible with C/C++, so to overcome this, Java was introduced.
-  Java
    -  Java is object-oriented (building applications in objects) and platform independent (meaning the application built on one platform can be executed on a different platform).

### Java
-  High-level, object-oriented programming language
-  Platform independent
-  Platforms Java can run on: Windows, Mac, Linux, Android
---
### Platform independent 
-    The code developed on one system can be executed on another system with a different operating system (as long as JVM is present). This is called platform independence.

### Class
-    A class is a logical entity; it gets life once an object is created
-    A class is a blueprint or master copy of an object.
-    A class is a non-primitive data type.
-    Without a class, we cannot create an object.
-    If any object is destroyed or modified, it does not affect any other object or the class itself.
-    By using a single class, we can create multiple similar objects.

#### How to create a class
```
class className {
    # Data Members
    # Methods
    # Nested Classes
    # Blocks
    # Constructors
}
```
#### Filename Rule
- For Java programs, the file name should match the class name.
- Example:
```
class Employee { }
// Filename: Employee.java
```
---
### Object
-    A physical entity
-    It is a real-world entity.
-    An instance of a class.
-    Each object has two aspects:
      1. States (Data Members/Variables)
         - Description / Information / Details of an object
         - Technically we call it as Data Memebers
      2. Behaviours (Methods)
         - Action perform by the object
         - Technically it as Methods
